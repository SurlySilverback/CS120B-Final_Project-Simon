# CS120B-Final_Project-Simon
A recreation of the old Simon pattern game.

Instructions:

When powered on, the game begins at the Welcome Screen.

Press Start (the far away button) to begin playing.

The board will flash LEDs in increasingly complex sequences. You must repeat the pattern correctly to proceed to the next level. Completing nine correct sequences will result in a win. Entering an incorrect button in any sequence will result in a loss.

The game contains failsafes to prevent cheating: only one button press is permitted at any time, and the game will always register the first button it detected as the intended entry.

Pressing Start button from either the win state or the lose state will return the game to the welcome screen. Pressing Start again will initiate a new game with a different randomly-generated sequence.
